# v1

Provider API is promise based, and user is expected to catch and handle errors,
promises will resolve whenever possible. It is up to the user to handle timeouts if promise hangs.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="typescript">
	{`
declare global {
	interface Window {
		z3us: {
			v1: {
				hasWallet: () => Promise<boolean>
				isConnected: () => Promise<boolean>
				connect: () => Promise<string>
				addresses: () => Promise<string[]>
				disconnect: () => Promise<void>
				encrypt: (message: string, fromAddress: string, toAddress: string) => Promise<string>
				decrypt: (message: string, fromAddress: string) => Promise<string>
				balances: () => Promise<unknown>
				stakes: () => Promise<unknown>
				unstakes: () => Promise<unknown>
				sendTransaction: (payload: { symbol: string; fromAddress: string; transaction: any }) => Promise<any>
			}
		}
	}
}
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

## Error handling

To handle errors simply use `try/catch` block, function will throw in case of action declined or unexpected error.
There is no timeout at the moment on the promise, be carefull to avoid deadlocks and handle resonable timouts on your webiste according to your action.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="typescript">
	{`
try {
	const response = await window.z3us.v1.balances()
} catch (error) {
	console.error(error)
}
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

## Connecting

Priaror to connecting please verify that `window.z3us` is available and that user has initialized their wallet. To **connect** use `window.z3us.v1.connect()` which will return currently selected address.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="typescript">
	{`
if (window.z3us) {
	return
}
const hasWallet = await window.z3us.v1.hasWallet()
if (!hasWallet) {
	return
}
const selectedAddress = await window.z3us.v1.connect()
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

Once user authorizes your website, the extension popup will not show again (unless they remove the permissions) and `connect` method will return selected address.

## Disconnecting

Your webiste might be disconnected by user from extension popup or you can call **disconnect** method, which will trigger extension popup again next time you call **connect**.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="typescript">
	{`
await window.z3us.v1.disconnect()
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

[Z3US](https://z3us.com) injects a global API into websites visited by its users at `window.z3us`. This API allows users to interact with wallet and [Radix DLT](https://www.radixdlt.com/).
